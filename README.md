# HYPER (brain decoding framework) ðŸ§  + ðŸ¤– + ðŸ“– = âœ¨ 

This repo accompanies the original paper 'Hyperrealistic neural decoding: Reconstruction of face stimuli using the GAN latent space' ([Dado et al., 2020 (biorxiv)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.168849v1)), introducing a very powerful yet simple framework for HYperrealistic reconstruction of PERception (HYPER) by elegantly integrating GANs in neural decoding. The goal was to reveal what information was present in the recorded brain responses by reconstructing the original stimuli presented to the participants.

In short, we **visualized** the information in the **brain** while looking at **face images**:

## The experiment

Two participants were looking at images of faces while we recorded their brain responses in the MRI scanner. After that, we trained a model to reconstruct what the participants were seeing from their fMRI recordings **alone**. 

Results are ground-breaking:

## The trick

The faces in the presented photographs **do not really exist**, but are artificially generated by a progressiveGAN ([PGGAN](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans)) from randomly sampled latent vectors. As it turns out, the GAN latent space and the neural manifold have an approximate linear relationship that can be exploited during brain decoding!

## A look into the future ðŸš€

For the first time, we have exploited the GAN latent space for neural decoding during perception of synthetic face photographs. Considering the speed of progress in the field of generative modeling (**new and improved GANs keep on popping up**), the HYPER framework will likely result in even more impressive reconstructions of perception. 

The sky is the limit.
